"""Flag text a language model finds implausible, using perplexity.

This is the baseline from Jain et al. (2023) and Alon and Kamfonas (2023).
Gradient-built attack suffixes (HotFlip, GCG, white-box PoisonedRAG) look
like gibberish to a causal language model and have much higher perplexity
than normal text. Fluent poison written by a language model does not: both
PoisonedRAG and TrustRAG show clean and poisoned perplexity overlapping.
Use this as one voter for the gibberish-suffix case, not as the only
poisoning detector.

Pass `perplexity=` to supply the score yourself. The default loads a small
causal model through `transformers` (`gpt2` unless `model_id` says
otherwise) and computes `exp(mean token negative log likelihood)`.

Calibrate `threshold` on your own clean memories. Ordinary English under
GPT-2 is often in the tens to low hundreds.
