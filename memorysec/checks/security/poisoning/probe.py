"""Probe-query traceback: a record that flips the answer on its own is suspect.

From RAGForensics (Zhang et al., WWW 2025, arXiv:2504.21668). Generate
probe questions from the record (doc2query or an LLM), retrieve, and
answer with and without the record. A record that changes the answer by
itself is treated as suspected poisoning.

This is also how a query-free store scan feeds query-time filters: the
generated probes are the queries FilterRAG would have needed.

All three steps are callbacks. Without them this detector returns nothing.
