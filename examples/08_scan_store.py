"""Example 8: scan an existing store and write a report.

The scan looks for poisoned facts, hidden instructions, and leaked secrets.
The HTML report is one file you can forward: a verdict, the records to
delete, quarantine, or review, findings by severity, and per finding the
masked excerpt, evidence, fix steps, and OWASP/CWE references. The same
findings are also written as SARIF (GitHub code scanning) and Markdown
(CI job summaries).

Run it with `python examples/08_scan_store.py`.

The same scan from the command line:

    memorysec scan jsonl export.jsonl --report report.html --json findings.json \
        --sarif results.sarif --markdown summary.md
