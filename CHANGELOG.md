## [Unreleased]

### Renamed: MemorySec is now Mimvo

The project, the PyPI distribution, the import package, and the CLI are now
called **Mimvo** ([mimvo.dev](https://mimvo.dev)). Nothing else about
scanning behaviour changed. To upgrade:

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `pip install memorysec` | `pip install mimvo` |
| `memorysec scan ...` | `mimvo scan ...` |
| `import memorysec` / `from memorysec import ...` | `import mimvo` / `from mimvo import ...` |
| `MemorySec`, `AsyncMemorySec` | `Mimvo`, `AsyncMimvo` |
| `MemorySecError` | `MimvoError` |
| `ScanReport.memorysec_version` (JSON `memorysec_version`) | `ScanReport.mimvo_version` (JSON `mimvo_version`) |
| JSON `schema_version` `1.2` | `2.0` (only the field rename above) |
| SARIF `partialFingerprints.memorysecFingerprint`, tool name `MemorySec` | `mimvoFingerprint`, tool name `Mimvo` |
| OpenTelemetry span `memorysec.scan` | `mimvo.scan` |

Fingerprint values are unchanged (they hash the rule id and record id only),
so existing tickets and suppression lists still match. GitHub code scanning
will treat the renamed SARIF fingerprint key as new alerts once.

### Since 0.1.0

Version 0.1.0 was an SDK that sat between an agent and its memory backend
(the project was called MemTrust then). Since then it has become a scanner:
it reads a memory store, reports poisoned facts, hidden instructions, and
leaked secrets, and recommends what to do with each record. It never writes
to the store. Everything below is relative to 0.1.0.

### Added

- **Store scanning.** `Mimvo().scan(source)` and `mimvo scan
  chroma|qdrant|pgvector|pinecone|jsonl|langchain|mem0`. Sources are
  read-only and stream records in batches; `--sample N` caps a scan.
- **LangChain, LangGraph, and mem0 sources.** `LangChainScanSource` reads
  LangChain vector stores (InMemoryVectorStore, Chroma, Qdrant, Pinecone,
  FAISS, PGVector, or any store by id with `get_by_ids`);
  `LangGraphStoreScanSource` reads a LangGraph `BaseStore` (LangGraph and
  LangMem long-term memory); `Mem0ScanSource` reads mem0's open-source
  `Memory` (whole store or one user/agent/run) and the hosted
  `MemoryClient`. CLI: `scan langchain --factory module:attr`,
  `scan mem0 --config FILE | --api-key KEY`. Extras: `langchain`,
  `langgraph`, `mem0`.
- **Reports.** A self-contained HTML report (verdict, triage plan,
  findings with masked excerpts, fix steps, OWASP and CWE links), JSON
  (`--json`, schema `2.0`), SARIF 2.1.0 (`--sarif`) for GitHub code
  scanning, and Markdown (`--markdown`) for job summaries and PR comments.
  Every format uses the rule catalogue in `mimvo.rules` and stable
  per-finding `fingerprint`s.
- **CI gates.** `--fail-on SEVERITY` exits `1` when a finding reaches that
  severity; `--min-confidence SCORE` ignores weaker findings for that gate;
  `-q` prints counts only.
- **Confidence.** Every finding has a `confidence` from 0 to 1: the
  combined score of the detectors that agreed on it (`1 - Π(1 - score)`).
  A finding below 0.6 is reported one severity step lower.
- **Detectors.** Each check runs a list of detectors and can require
  several to agree (`min_detectors`). Opt-in detectors: Hugging Face
  classifiers (Prompt Guard 2, Protect AI and deepset DeBERTa, Sentinel,
  Piiranha, StarPII), GLiNER, Presidio, detect-secrets, Azure Prompt
  Shields, Lakera Guard, entropy, known-answer and DataSentinel, embedding
  classifiers, perplexity and RAGuard, TrustRAG, hubness, embedding
  consistency, temporal NLI, probe queries, and live secret verification.
- **Scan errors.** `ScanReport.errors`, `complete`, and
  `records_with_errors` say which checks or detectors failed and on how
  many records.
- **`WriteGuard` and `RetrieveGuard`** (`mimvo.integrations`): run the
  scan on a memory before it is written, or on records just retrieved for a
  query. They replace 0.1.0's `check_write` / `check_read`.
- **Accuracy benchmark** (`benchmarks/`): the default detectors measured on
  public datasets they were not written against (GitHub's help articles,
  AgentDojo, BIPIA, InjecAgent, PoisonedRAG), with a held-out test split.
  Results are in `benchmarks/RESULTS.md`.
- **`mimvo.corpus`**: the packed record store and shared
  nearest-neighbour table corpus detectors use, with a pluggable
  `NeighbourIndex`. The `fast` extra installs numpy for the exact index.
- OpenTelemetry tracing (`mimvo[otel]`) and loguru logging; Mimvo
  never adds or removes log sinks.

### Changed

- **Default detectors are scored and read context.** The injection and
  poisoning heuristics judge each match by its sentence: help-text framing
  ("To disable 2FA, go to Settings"), conditionals, questions, limited
  scope ("guest Wi-Fi", "when on VPN"), advice, and quotations lower the
  score; sensitive assets, change markers, and directives aimed at the agent
  raise it; a prohibition ("never disable MFA") drops the match. Bare
  "review", "login", and "password" count only weakly. New coverage:
  paraphrased overrides, typos in trigger words, base64/hex/URL/HTML/
  reversed payloads, fake role tokens, task hijacking, authority spoofing,
  limit removal, data exfiltration, secrets pushed into channels, and links
  or falsehoods pushed into the agent's replies.
- **Severities follow one rule.** Explicit attack text is high
  (`persistent_instruction`, `memory_poisoning`, `destination_redirect`);
  model or behavioural evidence is medium (`known_answer`,
  `embedding_injection`, `adversarial_text`, `embedding_mismatch`,
  `temporal_contradiction`, `retrieval_flip`, `pii_detected`); corpus
  statistics are low (`poisoning_cluster`, `hub_record`); a leaked secret
  is critical.
- **A failing detector marks the scan incomplete.** It used to become a
  critical `check_error` finding with action `delete` on every record. Now
  the healthy detectors' results are kept, the failure is listed in
  `report.errors`, no finding is created, and the CLI exits `2` (unless
  `--allow-incomplete`). SARIF sets `executionSuccessful: false`; the HTML
  and Markdown reports say the scan is incomplete. With `fail_closed=True`
  (the default) `WriteGuard` refuses and `RetrieveGuard` drops records that
  were not fully checked.
- **Scans stream.** Records are no longer collected into one list. Text
  detectors run as records arrive; corpus detectors (TrustRAG, hubness,
  NLI) run afterwards against packed float32 vectors and one shared k-NN
  table. 50,000 records with 1,536-dimension vectors scan in about 90
  seconds and 1.1 GB. TrustRAG's `embed=` path embeds each text once per
  scan, and its lexical fallback compares records that share rare word
  pairs instead of every pair.
- `AsyncMimvo.scan` runs in a worker thread so it no longer blocks the
  event loop, and accepts async iterables.
- `Mimvo(checks=[...])` replaces a default check with the same name.

### Removed

- The write/read SDK: `check_write`, `check_read`, `protect`,
  `ProtectedMemory`, `AsyncProtectedMemory`, `revoke_source`, `Decision`,
  `ReadResult`, `SafeMemory`, `FilteredMemory`, `RevocationReport`, gate
  actions (`allow`, `allow_with_warning`, `block`), modes (`observe`,
  `warn`, `enforce`), and the `mimvo check` and `mimvo audit`
  commands. Use `Mimvo.scan`, or `WriteGuard` / `RetrieveGuard` on the
  write and read paths.
- Backends and adapters: `MemoryBackend`, `InMemoryBackend`,
  `FunctionBackend`, the Mem0 and LangGraph adapters, and the `zep`
  extra. Scan sources are the only store integrations.
- Correctness checks (contradiction, duplication, freshness,
  generalization), source/scope/tenant/authority models and checks,
  policies, the audit trail, secret redaction, the injectable clock, the
  provenance model, and the semantic analyzer.
- The `check_error` finding code.

### Fixed

- `mimvo scan chroma` failed on any collection with stored vectors:
  chromadb returns embeddings as a numpy array, which the source tested
  with `or`.
- pgvector vectors returned as text (`"[0.1,0.2]"`, without the pgvector
  adapter) were dropped, which silently turned the vector detectors off.
- `HubnessDetector` cached its table without its `k`, so two hubness
  detectors with different `k` shared one result.
- `WriteGuard` put a detector name in `Finding.check`.
- A reset link after "password:" was reported as a leaked password.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-12

Initial public release. Mimvo v0.1 is an SDK/MVP: a vendor-neutral trust
boundary between an AI agent and its memory backend.

### Added

- **Facade**: `Mimvo` and `AsyncMimvo` with `check_write`, `check_read`,
  `protect`, and `revoke_source`.
- **Domain models** (Pydantic v2): `Source`, `Scope`, `MemoryCandidate`,
  `MemoryRecord`, `Finding`, `Decision`, `Provenance`, `Policy`, plus enums for
  trust, severity, risk, action, status, and memory relationships.
- **Authority vs. confidence**: modeled as distinct fields, with authority
  derived from source trust by default.
- **Security checks**: persistent-instruction/injection detection, secret
  detection with redaction, tenant isolation, scope-promotion detection, and a
  low-authority policy-write check (`untrusted_policy_write`).
- **Correctness checks**: freshness/expiry, local duplicate detection,
  contradiction vs. supersession, and a generalization extension point.
- **Core enforcement** that cannot be bypassed by customizing the check list:
  cross-tenant/cross-user read isolation, tenant-match on write, and filtering
  of revoked/expired/quarantined/superseded records.
- **Policies**: declarative `Policy` (`when`/`require`) plus plain callables.
- **Semantic strategy**: deterministic `HeuristicSemanticAnalyzer` (default,
  offline) and an optional provider-agnostic `LLMSemanticAnalyzer` with
  timeouts and fail-open/closed behavior.
- **Backends**: `MemoryBackend`/`AsyncMemoryBackend` Protocols and in-memory
  reference implementations; adapters for Mem0 and LangGraph `BaseStore`; a
  generic `FunctionBackend`.
- **Audit**: JSON-serializable `AuditEvent`, `InMemoryAuditStore`, and
  `JSONLAuditStore`. Secrets are redacted from audit content.
- **Telemetry**: stdlib `logging` (no `basicConfig`) and optional OpenTelemetry
  tracing (injected, never global).
- **Modes**: `observe`, `warn`, `enforce` (default).
- **CLI**: `mimvo check` and `mimvo audit`.
- Test suite (unit, integration, security-invariant, property-based) and six
  runnable examples.
